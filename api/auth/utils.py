"""
Authentication utilities - DEPRECATED

All authentication is now handled by Firebase Authentication.
This file is kept for backwards compatibility but all functions are removed.

See api/auth/firebase.py for Firebase-related utilities.
"""

# All JWT and password functions have been removed.
# Firebase handles:
# - Password hashing and verification
# - Token creation and verification
# - Google OAuth
# - Email verification
# - Password reset
